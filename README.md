# Python Problem Sets — ML_AI Training

This repository contains problem sets I solved as part of my ML_AI training. The problems are designed to cover key Python programming concepts, including:

## ✅ Topics Covered

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)
- **Decorators**
  - Function decorators
  - Class method decorators
- **Iterators & Generators**
  - Custom iterators
  - Generator functions
- **File Handling**
  - Reading & writing data to files
  - Creating file iterators
- **Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy**
  - Understanding mutable objects and memory references
- **Miscellaneous**
  - Python best practices
  - Error handling & debugging complex class structures



## ✅ Structure

- Each file contains problems focusing on one or more concepts.
- Problems include class design, decorators, iterators, file parsers, and object management.
- Solutions include both beginner-friendly and advanced approaches.
